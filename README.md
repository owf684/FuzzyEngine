This is a game engine built around the pygame framework. It is still an early build and is lacking many feaures. This is built purely in pygame that includes all the gui elements. 
Please forgive some of the gui stuff, because it is absolute trash and needs lots of work still. I've built this all on a MAC so I don't know if this will work on a windows or linux box. Why don't you try it out and let me know.
Checkout the project page and help me add features and fix bugs. I'm hans SOLO right now. 

Anyways to get this to run you must have at least python 3.11 and pygame installed via PIP. That's it.
